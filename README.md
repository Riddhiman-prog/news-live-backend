# news-live-backend
Dear Akshat Sir,

As we had discussed earlier, I was facing deployment issues with my News Summarization project due to CORS errors and some API-related limitations.

I made several attempts to resolve the issue and explored multiple deployment options, but unfortunately, I wasn’t able to get it working live within the time frame.

As a result, I’m submitting the frontend and backend files separately for your review. To ensure full transparency, I’ve also recorded a video demonstrating the entire project working correctly on my local system — including the live news fetch and Gemini-powered summarization features.

I hope this submission format is acceptable. Please let me know if you need anything else or if there’s a specific way you’d like it packaged.

Thank you for your guidance and understanding throughout.

Best regards,

Riddhiman Rakshit
